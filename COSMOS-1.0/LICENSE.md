The LICENSEE may apply the PROGRAM in a pipeline to data owned by users other than the LICENSEE and provide these users the results of the PROGRAM provided LICENSEE does so for academic non-commercial purposes only.

LICENSEE agrees that the PROGRAM, in whole or part, shall not be used for any commercial purpose, including without limitation, as the basis of a commercial software or hardware product or to provide services.
