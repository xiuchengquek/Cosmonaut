COSMOS: A Python library for massively parallel workflows
=========================================================

**COSMOS** is a Python library for workflow management that allows formal description of pipelines and partitioning of jobs, focused on next-generation sequencing analysis. In addition, it includes a user-interface for tracking the progress of jobs, abstraction of the queuing system and fine-grained control over the workflow. Workflows can be created on traditional computing clusters as well as cloud-based services.  It is developed jointly by the `Laboratory for Personalized Medicine <http://lpm.hms.harvard.edu>`_ at Harvard Medical School and the `Wall Lab <http://wall-lab.stanford.edu/>`_ at Stanford University.
